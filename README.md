# IoT_NodeMCU_ESP8266
This repository contains source code necessary to launch an Node.js server and NodeMCU with ESP8266 and DHT22. 

## Node.js 
This is a design environment based on Google's V8 JavaScript engine. In this environment, we create a web server, server scripts and any auxiliary functions of web applications.

## MongoDB
It is an efficient NoSQL database with very efficient scalability. In this database we collect data such as temperature and humidity, which are sent from the NodeMCU module by HTTP request - GET.

## Express
This module acts as a web server and extends the Node.js environment to provide several key components to handle web requests.

## Nginx
HTTP proxy server that redirects all requests from the address "szustakowses.nazwa.pl" to the address of the Node.js server implemented on port 3400.

## ESP8266 NodeMCU
NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. It includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC. 

### How to program NodeMCU by Arduino IDE
1. Firstly download and open the Arduino IDE
2. Go to files and click on the preference in the Arduino IDE
3. Copy the below code in the Additional boards Manager
http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
click OK to close the preference Tab.
4. After completing the above steps , go to Tools and board, and then select board Manager
5. Navigate to esp8266 by esp8266 community and install the software for Arduino.
6. Program NodeMCU_ESP8266 with Arduino IDE using our code in folder NodeMCU.

Module collects data from the DHT22 sensor and sends them with a GET request to the WWW server. The correct data recording is signaled by blinking of the green diode and failure by red. In addition, the current temperature status is signaled by the color of the RGB diode.

## DHT22
Temperature and Humidity Sensor. Here are the pin definitions:

| Pin  | Symbol | Descriptions |
| ---: |     :---:      |          :--- |
| 1    | VCC            | Power supply 3.3V from NodeMCU   |
| 2    | DOUT       | Data output, connected to the pin SDA.     |
| 3    | NC       | Not use     |
| 4    | GND      |Ground     |
